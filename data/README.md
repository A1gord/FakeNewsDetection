In this directory you can see the [script](https://github.com/A1gord/GraduationProject/blob/master/data/generate_rdf.py) that generates RDF file from json dataset and [rules](https://github.com/A1gord/GraduationProject/blob/master/data/rules.rml.ttl) for it.

RDF is used as a knowledge graph storage.

I used [News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset) and [RMLMapper](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java).
